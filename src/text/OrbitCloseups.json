    "leo_body": "<p>Low altitudes in combination with short orbital periods make LEO satellites ideally situated for remote sensing missions, including Earth observation, military reconnaissance, spying, and other imaging applications. <br/><br/><em>Individual</em> LEO satellites are less useful for telecommunications because they move quickly across the sky and require extensive tracking from ground stations. <em>Large combinations</em> --or constellations-- of satellites, however, are able to provide high-bandwidth low-latency communications coverage in this orbit. Constellations consisting of many of the same or similar satellites are often launched together in LEO, effectively creating a ‘net’ around Earth, which allows them to cover large areas of Earth simultaneously by working together.</p>",

    "meo_subheader": "TYPES OF SATELLITES IN MEDIUM EARTH ORBIT",
    "meo_body": "Although over 90 percent of all satellites are situated in LEO and GEO, the less-crowded orbital regime is an ideal environment for a smaller subset of satellite systems, namely navigation satellites. Along with navigation satellites, businesses and government organizations use MEO to enhance communication to more remote parts of the world. Being at higher altitudes, satellites in MEO cover more of Earth’s surface per satellite than in LEO, and have lower transmission times and signal delay than those in GEO.",

    "heo_body": "Compared to GEO, HEOs are not limited to equatorial orbits and hence are able to cover landmasses of the Northern Hemisphere and also the Polar regions for both Fixed (FSS) and Mobile Satellite Service (MSS). Countries which need coverage over high latitude, Polar, or near-Polar areas make significant use of HEOs. Satellites in this orbit are used for communications, satellite radio, remote sensing, and other applications.",

    "gso_body": "Geosynchronous orbits allow satellites to maintain a set position over the globe, making them particularly useful for weather monitoring and allowing scientists to continuously observe a specific area to see how weather trends emerge and develop.",

    "geo_subheader": "TYPES OF SATELLITES IN GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT",
    "geo_body": "Satellites that most often reside in GEO are those that need to stay constantly above one particular place over Earth, such as telecommunication satellites, or those that benefit from monitoring the same area over time such as weather satellites. In the case of telecommunications satellites, antennas on Earth can be fixed to always stay pointed towards them without moving to allow for steady coverage. Weather satellites are particularly well-placed in this orbit because they can continually monitor and observe specific areas to see emerging weather trends.",
