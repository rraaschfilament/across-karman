    "leo_body_about" : "A low Earth orbit (LEO) is, as the name suggests, an orbit that is relatively close to Earth’s surface. Most of the man-made objects orbiting Earth are in LEO. Satellites in LEO do not have to follow a particular path around Earth, which makes for more route possibilities. The greatest risks are that space debris and defunct satellites in LEO can take hundreds of years to de-orbit naturally, and increases in satellite launches with little concern for end of life (EOL) plans intensifies this issue.",

A key feature of satellites in HEO is that they move faster when they are close to Earth than when they are farther away. This is because when the satellite is in perigee (the point of orbit closest to Earth), the gravitational pull from Earth is higher than when the satellite is in apogee (the point farthest from Earth).",

This makes satellites in GEO appear to be ‘stationary’ over a fixed position. Satellites in GEO cover a large range of the Earth so as few as three equally-spaced satellites can provide near global coverage. This is because when a satellite is this far from Earth, it can cover larger sections at once.",

To attain geosynchronous (and also geostationary) Earth orbits, a spacecraft must first be launched into GTO, circularize the orbit by turning parallel to the equator at apoapsis, and fire its rocket engine (or apogee motor). Launch vehicles' capabilities are often compared based on the amount of mass they can lift to GTO.",
